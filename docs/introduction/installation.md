## Installation

Nix can be installed in multiple ways:

1. As a package manager on macOS/Linux/WSL.
2. Manage the entire system environment on NixOS, it's a Linux distribution that uses Nix to manage the system.

This book focuses on introducing the usage of NixOS & Flakes, so we will skip the content related only to Nix.

The installation process of NixOS is simple, and we won't go into details here. Please visit the official download site for more information: <https://nixos.org/download.html>.
