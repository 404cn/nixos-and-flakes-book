## Installation


Nix can be installed in multiple ways:

1. Install on macOS/Linux/WSL as a package manager.
2. Install NixOS, it's a Linux distribution that uses Nix to manage the entire system environment.

This book aims to introduce the usage of NixOS & Flakes, so we just skip the content related only to Nix here.

The installation process of NixOS is simple, and I won't go into details here.

Please just go to the official download site to see more details: <https://nixos.org/download.html>
