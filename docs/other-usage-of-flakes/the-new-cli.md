## Usage of The New CLI

after enabling `nix-command` & `flake`, you can use `nix help` to get all the info of [New Nix Commands][New Nix Commands], some useful examples are listed below:

```bash
# `nixpkgs#ponysay` means `ponysay` from `nixpkgs` flake.
# [nixpkgs](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs) contains `flake.nix` file, so it's a flake.
# `nixpkgs` is a falkeregistry id for `github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixos-unstable`.
# you can find all the falkeregistry ids at <https://github.com/NixOS/flake-registry/blob/master/flake-registry.json>
# so this command means install and run package `ponysay` in `nixpkgs` flake.
echo "Hello Nix" | nix run "nixpkgs#ponysay"

# this command is the same as above, but use a full flake URI instead of falkeregistry id.
echo "Hello Nix" | nix run "github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixos-unstable#ponysay"

# instead of treat flake package as an application,
# this command use `devShells.example` in flake `zero-to-nix`'s outputs, to setup the development environment,
# and then open a bash shell in that environment.
nix develop "github:DeterminateSystems/zero-to-nix#example"

# instead of using a remote flake, you can open a bash shell using the flake located in the current directory.
mkdir my-flake && cd my-flake
## init a flake with template
nix flake init --template "github:DeterminateSystems/zero-to-nix#javascript-dev"
# open a bash shell using the flake in current directory
nix develop
# or if your flake has multiple devShell outputs, you can specify which one to use.
nix develop .#example

# build package `bat` from flake `nixpkgs`, and put a symlink `result` in the current directory.
mkdir build-nix-package && cd build-nix-package
nix build "nixpkgs#bat"
# build a local flake is the same as nix develop, skip it
```
